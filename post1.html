          <p>Hi guys, Today I am very excited to tell you about the start of  my journey on this path and hope that you are also excited to know it. I hope that you will also get some motivation from this post. So let's start, as you know that to keep going on a path or to keep doing something you should have a strong interest in it and interest does not come by birth. As it is an important factor so let's talk how I developed a very strong interest in this field.</p>

          <p>The interest that I developed in this field is because of the mysteries that are hidden in this field of thechnology. I started to learn this field more and more because to discover or develop something you should know about it by heart. When I started learning I came to know that this is a very huge field and this made me more excited. Some of you will think that I learned programming from professional courses and paid a lot money. If you think so than you are absolutely wrong. Now take a look on how I learn programming.</p>

          <p>I have not spent a single penny for learning. Wait, what he is saying, has he gone mad. This is what you are thinking right now. But that's true. I have learned programming from online videos free of cost. I remember that to learn python completely I watched aroud 113 videos and to learn Django I watched 103 videos, all absolutely free. I can tell you where I got the videos but if you're passionate than you can find it yourself as I did.</p>

          <p>Once you develop a strong interest it is not necessary that you will not quit although the chances gets decreased. So to move on with same interest you should have two things, first one is motivation and another one is a long term goal. Motivation acts same as self-start in a motorbike it accelerates your progress and long term goal gives us a balance on this path.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">My Motivation : Hacking</h2>

          <p>People can have different motivations. The thing that became my motivation to start is HACKING because how exciting it is to control someone's devices without his/her knowledge. Although it is illegal but I think if you are learning and not trying to harm anyone. Then there is no problem. </p>

          <p>Learning hacking was a very difficult task as no one want's to teach it because of various policies and those who teach asks for a large amount. However, I managed it. If you don't have a pc and can't afford it. If you think that  you can't do anything as you don't have money then know one thing, I also don't have a pc or laptop. I always code on my phone using various applications and I am writing this post also on my android phone which is not very advanced. I never gave up and found various ways to do hacking and programming on my android phone as according to me, </p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote"><p style="text-align:center">Until and unless something isn't IMPOSSIBLE, there exists a chance.</p></blockquote>

          <p>I remember that to operate some hacking tools, one which is my favourite is Metasploit, I used a application called Termux which is a Linux terminal emulator for android but with time I realised that using someone else's code or programms is not that much interesting as compared to writing your own tools and then use them. So this became my long term goal i.e. to learn programming so that I can develop my own tools and use them for hacking.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Long Term Goal : Developing Tools and Libraries</h2>

          <p>If you're are programmer then using prewritten library is not much interesting when you can write yor own libraries and can contribute in the community. So, I want to learn so that I can write my own libraries and tools and ultimately this is my long term goal which is balancing me on this path.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">Always stay motivated and have a long term goal and surely a proper strategy to achieve it.</span>

          <p>So, This is all about starting of my journey and what I want to achieve in future.</p>

          <p>Stay Connected, if you also want to join this revolution and want to learn more about programming. If you want to learn Python from Zero to Hero follow me on Instagram and Facebook.</p>
