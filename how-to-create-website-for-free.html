          <p>Hello Guys, Today I'm very excited to discuss a trending topic i.e. HOW TO MAKE MONEY ONLINE WITH ZERO INVESTMENT. All of you are willing to make your own website without investing. I will tell you how can you create a responsive static website with very little coding and you will also be able to host it for free with your custom domain. I will also tell you how can you buy a domain for free without using your credit card. Hope this post will help you and you will love it. First let us talk about  what is static website and what is the difference between static and dynamic website.</p>
  
          <h2 class="section-heading">What Is A Static Website?</h2>
          <p>A static website is a website which is created only using HTML, CSS and Basic JavaScript without using any backend programming. There sites perform all the tasks from client side as there is no server side programs in these sites. Whereas a dynamic website involves both client side and server side programming. Client dide is usually written or designed using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and server side programming can be done using various languages like Python, JavaScript, Php, etc. Hope you understood the difference between these two types of websites. In this tutorial we are going to learn how to develop static website, we will not focus on dynamic website.</p>
  
          <h2 class="section-heading">Things To Keep In Mind Before Creating A Website</h2>
         
          <p>Before you start making your website you should have an idea or a  strategy on which project you are going to work on. Ask a few questions from you before starting like The idea on which you are going to work is beneficial to you or not? Are you having a proper plan to execute before creating your website? Why are you creating it? What's the need of a website? Are you having proper content for the website? These questions will help you to create your website better. Once you know why are you creating your website and what is the need of a website there comes a task to select name of your website.</p>
          
          <h2 class="section-heading">How To Choose Name Of You Website</h2>
          
          <p>Everything depends on the name of your website. Which name you are going to choose depends upon what content or service you are going to provide. Few things that everyone should care about is that the should not be more than three words, the name should completely dscribe your service, it should be eye catching and unique. When you're ready with your name there comes the need to design your website.</p>
          
          <h2 class="section-heading">Designing Your Website.</h2>

          <p>There are many ways in which you can design your website but I will discuss about the easiest one. One way is that you can write your own code using HTML CSS and JavaScript if you know how to code but this is not a good idea as everyone doesn't know how to code in all these languages. So, what is the best idea? I will recommend you to download the desired template online and can make changes afterwards like  changing title and content. I think everybody who is thinking of making a website knows this much of HTML and can make desired changes in the downloaded template. Now the question arises from where you can download template for free. There are many sites that provide free templates and most if them don't allow you to remove the credits from footer and this is not a big problem. The website I recommend is Bootstrap because templates that they provide are easy to use. If you want to add more components to your template you can also do it using bootstrap. You can copynand paste the code that they provide for different components like navigation bar, alerts, forms, etc. Using these components you can make your website more attractive. I think this information is enough for designing your website. Now it is the the tme to host your website for free with custom Domain. And how can you buy a domain for free without using credit card.</p>
         
          <h2 class="section-heading">Buying Domain Name For Free</h2>
          
          <p>Everybody wants to host the website on a domain name of his/her choice not on a subdomain but many of you are not having enough money to afford a domain name because of which you want to buy a domain for free. So I will tell you where you can buy domain for free and you don't need any type of card or bank account to buy it you can buy just only by signing in with your email. So the wait is over now and the website which will fulfill all your desires is Freenom. You can go and can sign up in this site and can buy domain name for free but the limitation is that you can only by .tk, .cf, .ml, .ga, and .gq not .com, .in, .org, .net, etc. but this is not a big issue. Oce have bought your domain you need to host your website with it. </p>
          
          <h2 class="section-heading">Hosting Website For Free</h2>

          <p>You can host your static website on different sites for free but if you want to host it with your own domain than the easiest way is to host it on GitHub because it gives your site protection also i.e. https instead of http and you can also make changes to your website very easily because it is a version control system and the thing that matters to you is that all the services that GitHub provides are free of cost. So let's start the procedure of hosting your website. First you need to create an account on GitHub. Once you have created your account you need to create a repository. It is nothing just like a folder where you need to keep all the files of your website. To create a new repository click on create repository and type the name of your repository, keep the other options as default and click on create repository. Now place all the files of your static website in this repository. You can do it by simply drag and drop after clicking on upload files or can upload by choosing from your device. When the files get uploaded you can click on comit changes button at the bottom. Now go to settings and scroll down and make sure you're repository is public, scroll more and goto GitHub pages section under Source select the branch as master branch and in  folder select root folder and click on save. In domain name type your domain name and check the Enforce Https box. Wait for sometime and then refresh the page. You will see a green message displaying your site is published at https://www.yourdomainname/ . Now goto freenom and login with your account. From menu button select services and then click on MyDomain. You will see your domain name there, now goto manage domain and from menubar click on manage freenom DNS. Fill the records as shown in the image below (In last record you will fill yourdomainname.github.io instead of passionatecoders.github.io, don't use your domain here i.e. don't type .tk or any other domain here For example if you're domain name is bestcoder.tk then you will type bestcoder.github.io). Once you have correctly filled all the records click on save. It takes about half an hour to update your DNS records. Once these records gets updated you can go to your website the url of which will be https://www.yourdomainname/ Hurah! you have made your website and also published it with your domain without spending any money.</p>

          <p>Keep in mind that you can only publish a static website by this method. Hope you loved this tutorial and were able to publish your website easily.</p>
